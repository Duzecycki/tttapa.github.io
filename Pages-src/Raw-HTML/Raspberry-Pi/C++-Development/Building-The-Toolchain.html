<p>
    To compile software for the Raspberry Pi, you need a cross-compilation toolchain. It's a collection of files and
    programs that you can run on your computer, and that produce a binary that can be executed on the Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>
    I don't like to do a lot of installations on my main Linux box, so I build most of it inside of a Docker container.
    This has the added benefit that all builds are reproducible, and it's easy to undo the previous step or even start
    from scratch.
</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>
    You need Docker and Docker Compose to build the toolchain.<br>
    You can find detailed installation instructions here:

<h4>Dockefiles</h4>
<p>
    The actual Dockerfiles are on my GitHub, I'll briefly go over them on this page.

</p>

<h3>Crosstool-NG</h3>

<p>
    The toolchain is built using <a href="https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng">Crosstool-NG</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It is installed in a CentOS 7 Docker container, because CentOS 7 was the oldest OS that I had to run the toolchain
    on. In this context, oldest refers to the Linux kernel version and the glibc version. They are backwards compatible,
    so you can run software compiled for an old version on a computer with a newer version, but you can't run software
    compiled for a new version on a computer with an older version.
</p>
<p>
    The following Dockerfile downloads, builds and installs Crosstool-NG to the <code>~/.local</code> directory
    of the container.

"name": "Dockerfile",
"file": "$HOME/GitHub/RPi-Toolchain/toolchain/docker/crosstool-ng/Dockerfile"
}
<p>
    The list of dependencies can be found on Crosstool-NG's GitHub:

</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi 3B+ 64-bit Cross-Compilation Toolchain</h3>

<p>
    The following Dockerfile builds the toolchain for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running a 64-bit operating system.
</p>
@codesnippet{
"name": "Dockerfile",
"file": "$HOME/GitHub/RPi-Toolchain/toolchain/docker/aarch64-toolchain/Dockerfile"
}
<p>
    The configuration is based on the <code>aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu</code> sample that comes with Crosstool-NG:
    <a href="https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/tree/master/samples/aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu">
        https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/tree/master/samples/aarch64-rpi3-linux-gnu</a>
</p>
<p>
    I changed the GCC version to the latest stable one, and the Linux kernel and glibc versions to match the versions
    that the Ubuntu Server 18.04 image ships with.
</p>
<p>
    The build took around 25 minutes on a 2018 Dell XPS i7-8750H, and 45 minutes on a 2017 Dell XPS i7-7700HQ.
</p>

<h3>Raspberry Pi 3B+ 32-bit Cross-Compilation Toolchain</h3>

<p>
    Even though the Raspberry Pi 3B+ has a 64-bit ARMv8/AArch64 CPU, at the time of writing, the Raspbian distribution
    is still only 32 bits. To be able to cross-compile software for this platform, you'll need a 32-bit cross-compiler.
</p>
@codesnippet{
"name": "Dockerfile",
"file": "$HOME/GitHub/RPi-Toolchain/toolchain/docker/aarch32-toolchain/Dockerfile"
}
<p>
    The configuration is based on the <code>armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf</code> sample that comes with Crosstool-NG:
    <a href="https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/tree/master/samples/armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf">
        https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng/tree/master/samples/armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf</a>
</p>
<p>
    I changed the GCC version to the latest stable one, and the Linux kernel and glibc versions to match the versions
    that the Raspbian Stretch image ships with. <br>
    Even though the CPU will be running in 32-bit mode, you can still use the ARMv8 NEON instructions, so I changed the
    compiler's default FPU flag to <code>neon-fp-armv8</code>. I haven't tested if it actually makes any difference.
</p>
<p>
    The build took around 25 minutes on a 2018 Dell XPS i7-8750H, and 45 minutes on a 2017 Dell XPS i7-7700HQ.
