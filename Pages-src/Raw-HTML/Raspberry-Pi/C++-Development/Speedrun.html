<h3>Setup of the necessary software on your computer</h3>

<h4>Install Docker</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-docker.sh"
}
<h4>Install some other tools</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-tools.sh"
}
<h4>Clone the RPi-Cpp-Toolchain repository</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-clone.sh"
}
<h4>Pull the toolchain and the cross-compiled libraries from Docker Hub</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-pull-docker.sh"
}

<h3>Setup of the necessary software on the Raspberry Pi</h3>

<h4>OS installation and network configuration</h4>
<p>
    If you haven't set up your Pi yet, follow the instructions on how to do so
    for <a href="../Installation+Setup/Setting-up-Ubuntu.html">Ubuntu</a> or for
    <a href="#TODO">Raspbian (TODO)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure that you have the following set up correctly:
    <ol>
        <li>A working network connection to the same local network as your computer.</li>
        <li>The hostname and DNS or mDNS configured correctly so you can find the Pi on the network as
            <code>rpi3.local</code>, even if its IP address changes.</li>
        <li>An SSH configuration on your computer so you can SSH into the Pi using <code>ssh RPi3</code>.</li>
        <li>An SSH key from your computer installed in the <code>authorized_keys</code> of the Pi so you can SSH into it
            without having to enter your password each time.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h4>Installation of the staging area</h4>

<p>
    We have to install all libraries and tools that were cross-compiled to the Pi. This is as easy
    as just copying over the archive containing the staging area, and then installing it to the root
    directory. All files in the staging area are either in <code>/usr/local</code> or in <code>/opt</code>,
    so it won't interfere with software you installed through the package manager.
</p>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-install-staging.sh"
}
<p>
    To verify that the installation was successful, you can try running the newly installed Python interpreter:
</p>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-install-check.sh"
}

<h3>Try out the C++ example project</h3>

<h4>Configure and build the example project</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-cmake-build.sh"
}
<h4>Copy the tests and the Hello World program to the Pi</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-copy-cpp-proj.sh"
}
<h4>Run the tests and the Hello World program on the Pi</h4>
@codesnippet{
"file": "resources/speedrun-run.sh"
}
