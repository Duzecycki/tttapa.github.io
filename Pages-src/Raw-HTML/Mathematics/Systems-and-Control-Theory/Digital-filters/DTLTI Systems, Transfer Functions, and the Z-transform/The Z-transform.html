<h3>Signals as a Sum of Delta Functions</h3>

<p>
    Any discrete signal can be written as an infinite sum of scaled Kronecker 
    delta functions.
    $$ x[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} x[k] \delta[n-k] $$
    You can easily see that all terms where \(n \ne k\) are zero, because the 
    Kronecker delta is zero in that case.
    Only the term for \(n = k\) is non-zero, in which case the Kronecker delta 
    is one, so the result is just \(x[k]\). 
    This is a consequence of the sifting property of the delta function, 
    covered in the <a href="Impulse and Step Response.html">previous page</a>.
</p>

<h3>DTLTI Transformations as Convolutions</h3>

<p>
    You can express the output of any discrete-time linear time-invariant system
    \(T\) as the convolution of the input with the impulse response of the 
    system, \(h[n]\):
    $$ T\left(x[n]\right) = x[n] * h[n] $$
</p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
<p>
    The proof itself is very simple: We just decompose the input as a sum of
    delta functions, as described in the previous paragraph, and then we use the
    linearity and time-invariance to bring the \(T\) operator inside of the 
    summation.
    $$ \begin{split}
    y[n] &amp;= T\left(x[n]\right) \\
    &amp;= T\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k] \delta[n-k]\right) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} T\left(x[k] \delta[n-k]\right) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k] T\left(\delta[n-k]\right) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x[k] h[n-k] \\
    &amp;\triangleq x[n] * h[n]
    \end{split} $$
    The \(*\) symbol in the last step is called the convolution operator, and it
    is defined as the sum in the step before it. \(\quad\Box\)
