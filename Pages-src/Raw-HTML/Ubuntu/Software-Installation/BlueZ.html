<p>
    This is an installation guide for the latest version of BlueZ, the official Linux
    Bluetooth protocol stack, on Ubuntu.
</p>
<p>
    I used this to get MIDI over BLE working on Ubuntu 16.04.
</p>

<h3>Installing the Dependencies</h3>

<p>
    Use your package manager to install the following dependencies:
    <pre
        class="console"><code>sudo apt install libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev libdbus-1-dev libasound2-dev</code></pre>
    You'll also need the usual build tools, so install them as well if you
    haven't already:
    <pre class="console"><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></pre>
</p>

<h3>Downloading BlueZ</h3>

<p>
    You can download the latest version from
    <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">www.bluez.org</a>, or download it directly
    from the command line. Then extract the file you downloaded.
    <pre class="console"><code>cd /tmp</code>
<code>wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.50.tar.xz</code>
<code>tar -xf bluez-5.50.tar.xz</code></pre>
</p>

<h3>Building and Installing BlueZ</h3>

<p>
    Finally, run the configure script and make and install everything.
    Also reinstall the version from the package manager, as explained
    <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1064406/installing-bluez-5-50-doesnt-update-bluetoothd">here</a>.
    <pre class="console"><code>cd bluez-5.50</code>
<code>./configure --enable-midi --with-systemdsystemunitdir=/etc/systemd/system</code>
<code>make</code>
<code>sudo make install</code>
<code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall bluez</code></pre>
    That's it! After rebooting, MIDI over BLE should work.<br>
    The first time after rebooting, my computer seemed kind of slow, but
    rebooting again solved that problem.
